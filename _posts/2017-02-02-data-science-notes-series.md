# Data Science Notes Series

If you've been following my blog, you'll realize that I've just made some changes to my blog. I removed some posts and also changed the link that collates all those posts. Why? Because I was basically converting my jupyter notebooks to markdown documents and posting them with little to no change. And that doesn't add any value to those notebooks. And I'm updating them all the time - when I go through a topic, then I remember something interesting or useful that I want to add in to a previous notebook. (And it's just a little tedious to have to keep updating the blog posts too.)

So I'm going to switch it up a little. I will still continue working on the data science notes series but I'm going to leave them hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jocelyn-ong/data-science-notes){:target="_blank"}. And when I hit on an interesting topic or project, I'll put it up on the blog!

Thanks for reading this! I hope you'll hope over to my [GitHub](https://github.com/jocelyn-ong/data-science-notes){:target="_blank"} or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joce_ong){:target="_blank"} where I share interesting data related posts!

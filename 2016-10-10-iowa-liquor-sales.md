## Introduction
- origins of the project, reason for doing the project
This is Project 3 from the Immersive and we'll be working with the Iowa Liquor Sales dataset. This is also our first group project, and I'll be collaborating with [JP](jpfreeley.github.io) and [Joshua].

This week, we'll be looking at the data from a market research perspective:
> A liquor store owner in Iowa is looking to expand to new locations and has hired you to investigate the market data for potential new locations. The business owner is interested in the details of the best model you can fit to the data so that his team can evaluate potential locations for a new storefront.

## About the dataset

The dataset we'll be using can be downloaded directly from the [data.iowa.gov](https://data.iowa.gov/Economy/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy){:target:'_blank'} website. It's a large dataset and to facilitate working with the data, we'll be looking at a [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx2SHQGVqWaseDB4QU9ZSVFDY2M/view?usp=sharing){:target='_blank'} that is 10% of a [filtered version](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pf5n5sgfgiri3i8/AACkaMeL_i_WgZ00rpxOOcysa?dl=0){:target='_blank'} of the original dataset.

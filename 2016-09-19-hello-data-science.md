This is where I start my journey into the world of data.

#### Not true
I first became interested in data when I attended a talk - "Opportunities in Data Analytics & Data Science" - hosted by General Assembly Singapore. I wanted to find out more about it after, but when you search for data science on [Google](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=data%20science), you're immediately hit with a massive information overload - and they don't always agree. 

I found that General Assembly had a part-time Data Science course and I thought, "I should just jump in and find out for myself!" That was 6 months ago in March 2016. I took the course in New York because Singapore didn't have the course yet.

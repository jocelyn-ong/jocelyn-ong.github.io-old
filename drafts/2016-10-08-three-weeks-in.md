I'm three weeks into my 12-week Data Science Immersive and I thought it would be a good opportunity to look back on how these three weeks have passed and what I have gained from it.

## Lessons
Prior to the Immersive, I picked up Python through online courses and took the Part-Time Data Science course at General Assembly and I think that gave me a strong foundation for the Immersive. I had a break between the Part-Time and the Immersive and looked through a couple of machine learning and data analytics courses

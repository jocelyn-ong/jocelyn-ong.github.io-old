Exploring the top Kickstarter campaigns

# Introduction

This week we were given a surprise group project! No topic, no groups, no rules (almost) - find your group mates, find some data, and do something with it! This time our groups were a little bigger - I got grouped with Sara, Kristen, [JP](https://jpfreeley.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, [Michael](https://mroman09.github.io/){:target="_blank"} and [Peida (Peter)](https://peidacai.github.io/about/){:target="_blank"}.

# Finding our data

This was like finding a problem statement for our capstone - what do we want to do and can we find the data for that? We decided to look at datasets available online and find one that we could agree to work on. We finally settled on a dataset containing the [4000 most backed Kickstarter projects](http://datapolymath.paperplane.io/#Data-Sources){:target="_blank"}.

# Project goals

We had a short timeline for this project - presentations are due the next day. The requirements were to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on our dataset, and maybe if we had time, we could run a regression/ classification model on it. We decided to stick with the EDA first, and see what we could come up with the next day before moving on to regression/ classification.

# About the data

The dataset contained information on the 4000 most backed Kickstarter projects, including the project blurb (short description), url, tier information, location, goal amount and total pledged amount. For our EDA, we wanted to see how each of these related to the others.

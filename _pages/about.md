Hello! I'm Jocelyn!

I'm a graduate of the part-time Data Science course and the Data Science Immersive, both at General Assembly New York. My prior experience includes corporate income tax compliance and advisory for small and medium enterprises as well as multi-national corporations.

I'm a Singaporean taking a short break from work and exploring the United States of America. I used part of this time to enroll in the two data science courses (above) and learn more about the field. Currently, I'm doing a lot of self learning after the courses to ensure that I keep my skills sharp and also to learn about more advanced tools that the courses didn't cover.

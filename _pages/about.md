Hello! I'm Jocelyn!

I'm an aspiring data scientist, a graduate of the part-time Data Science course and currently enrolled in the Data Science Immersive, both at General Assembly New York. My prior experience includes corporate income tax compliance and advisory for small and medium enterprises as well as multi-national corporations.

This blog is for write-ups of my projects from the Immersive as well as any insights during the my course of learning data science. I hope you enjoy reading them!

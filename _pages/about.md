Hello! I'm Jocelyn!

I'm an aspiring data scientist and I'm currently enrolled in General Assembly New York's Data Science Immersive. My prior experience includes corporate income tax compliance and advisory for small and medium enterprises as well as multi-national corporations.

This blog is for write-ups of my immersive projects as well as any insights during the my course of learning data science. I hope you enjoy reading them!
